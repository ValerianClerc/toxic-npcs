# Toxic NPCs

This plugin is intended to make the RuneScape playing experience more immersive by roasting players for their mistakes.

## Using the plugin

First, download the Quest Helper from the Runelite Plugin Hub. You should then be able to see the Toxic NPCs configuration under RuneLite's configuration sidebar. This will allow you to configure how often you would like to be roasted by specifying a cooldown between roasts (in seconds).
